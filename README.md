# ListDiff

__ListDiff__ is a Swift port of [IGListKit](https://github.com/Instagram/IGListKit)'s [IGListDiff](https://github.com/Instagram/IGListKit/blob/master/Source/IGListDiff.mm).
It is an implementation of [an algorithm by Paul Heckel](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=359467&dl=ACM&coll=DL) that calculates the diff between 2 arrays.

## Motivation

The motivation for this project came from the following [challenge](https://github.com/Instagram/IGListKit/issues/76) which I learnt about it from [Ryan Nystrom](https://twitter.com/_ryannystrom)'s [talk](https://engineers.sg/video/scaling-at-large-lessons-learned-rewriting-instagram-s-feed-ios-conf-sg-2016--1218) at [iOSConf.SG](http://iosconf.sg).

## Getting Started

```bash
swift package generate-xcodeproj
```

## Usage

```swift
// TOOD: (stan@trifia.com) Provides usage detailsâ€¦
import ListDiff
```

## Rationale

During the port, I made several decisions which I would like to rationalize here.

- _Using caseless enum as namespace._ See [Erica Sadun's post here](http://ericasadun.com/2016/07/18/dear-erica-no-case-enums/).
- _No support for index paths._ Decided that this is out of the scope.
- _Stack vs Heap._ AFAIK, Swift does not advocates thinking about stack vs heap allocation model, leaving the optimization decisions to compiler instead. Nevertheless, some of the guideline do favour `struct` more, so only `List.Entry` is a (final) class as we need reference to its instances.
